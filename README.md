# CV Website

This is my CV Website, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this site is to serve as an online CV where people can easily learn about me, my background, and the projects I've worked on. It includes a simple and clean design that focuses on readability and ease of navigation.

The website features a fixed navigation bar that makes it easy to move between sections. The About Me section provides an introduction to who I am, my education, and my interests. Below that, the Projects section showcases some of the work I've done, with clickable links so visitors can explore them further. Finally, there is a Contact section with my email and GitHub so that people can easily get in touch.

Everything on this site is built with just HTML and CSS, keeping it lightweight and straightforward. The design is fully responsive, ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.

### File Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
/root
│── assets/              # Contains images used on the site
│── css/                 # Holds the main stylesheet
│── index.html           # The main HTML file
│── README.md            # Project documentation
```
